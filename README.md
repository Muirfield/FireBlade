# FireBlade

FireBlade gives you a flaming sword. When you have an Iron or a Golden
sword on hand you can enter:

	/fireblade

This will turn on your flaming sword. Which will toggle colors to
indicate its active state. When you hit another player (or mobs
perhaps) with it, it will deal damage but also will set the target on
fire.
